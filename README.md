Text Indexer is an application that helps to locate a particular text faster in given set of
large data by keeping track of words and their locations in files. This console-based
application uses standard I/O for searching the words in the files. The purpose of storing
an index is to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a
search query. Without an index, the search engine would scan every document in the
corpus, which would require considerable time and computing power. The goal of the
project is to achieve optimal searching by using Hashing.
